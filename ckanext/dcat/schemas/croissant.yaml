#   help_text: 'Croissant datasets must declare that they conform to the versioned schema: http://mlcommons.org/croissant/1.0'
#   form_placeholder: http://mlcommons.org/croissant/1.0
#   required: true

# schema:name | schema:Text | ONE | required
- field_name: title # This default back-end field name is 'title' in order not to clash with 'name' below, which must remain as it is for internal use
  label: Name # This front-end field name is 'Name' in order to match the Croissant specification
  help_text: The name of the dataset.
  required: true # This is true anyway from the preset, but adding this here just to be clear
  preset: cr_title # We have defined this preset in schemas/presets.yaml rather than use the other ckanext-scheming 'title' preset, as if this field isn't given then that other preset re-defines this field by the URL slug, which isn't really desired. As the Croissant specification says that this field is required, it's best that it actually errors if not given, and to use it to lead the URL slug rather than the other way around. The URL slug can still be set to something different, if needed.

# schema:url | schema:URL | ONE | required
- field_name: name # This default back-end field name is 'name' for internal use. If a field with back-end field name of 'name' isn't present at all, then this will result in errors. The value of this field is the URL slug i.e. not the full URL but the part after the final slash. Note that this does not have to be related to the field with front-end field name of 'Name' above.
  label: URL
  # help_text: The URL of the dataset. This generally corresponds to the Web page for the dataset.
  required: true # This is true anyway from the preset, but adding this here just to be clear
  preset: dataset_slug

# @id | schema:Text | ONE | optional
- field_name: id_given
  label: ID
  help_text: Unique ID of the dataset for internal graph references. Auto-generated if not provided.
  required: false

# schema:description | schema:Text | ONE | required
- field_name: notes # Default back-end field name. This is 'description' for resources.
  label: Description
  help_text: Description of the dataset.
  required: true
  form_snippet: markdown.html

# schema:keywords | schema:DefinedTerm / schema:Text / schema:URL | MANY | recommended
- field_name: tag_string # Default back-end field name. This mustn't change, as there's a step looking for this name when this preset is applied, which will result in an error without it.
  label: Keywords
  help_text: A set of keywords associated with the dataset, either as free text, or a DefinedTerm with a formal definition.
  required: false
  preset: tag_string_autocomplete # This preset causes this field to appear in dataset_dict under the key 'tags' regardless of the chosen field_name here

- field_name: version
  label: Version
  help_text: The version of the dataset following the requirements at https://docs.mlcommons.org/croissant/docs/croissant-spec.html#version.
  required: false

# cr:isLiveDataset | schema:Boolean | ONE | optional
# If the value choices here are actual booleans rather than strings, with 'boolean_validator' applied, then this causes problems as this is a non-required field and so we want a default value of None if set to blank, but:
#   - If set to blank, this defaults to False in dataset_dict rather than None, and therefore shows up in the profile view whereas it shouldn't.
#   - If set to False, this resets to blank. Due to the previous note, this does show up in the profile view as desired but for the wrong reason, and is blank in the info edit form and the info display table.
# Ultimately, after a lot of experimentation, it was simpler to take these values as strings, in which format they remain in the dataset_dict, and convert to booleans in profiles/croissant.py instead.
- field_name: is_live_dataset
  label: Is live dataset
  help_text: Whether the dataset is a live dataset.

  required: false

# schema:creator | schema:Organization / schema:Person | MANY | required
# Following schemaorg.py, this will fall back to 'organization' if not present
# TODO: The 'required: true' setting here is not honoured due to the repeating subfields. We can make one of the subfields required and that is honoured if at least one set of subfields exists, but all sets of subfields can be removed by the user via the remove button, so that's a loophole. The 'multiple_text' preset also uses a remove button but it's disabled if there's only one element in the list, which is the behaviour we really want here. This comes down to modifying the ckanext-scheming extension. The relevant code is in these two files (search for 'click'):
