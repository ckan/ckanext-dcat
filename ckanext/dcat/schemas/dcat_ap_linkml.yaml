description: 'This LinkML schema representation of DCAT-AP 3.0.0 was automatically
  created from these [JSON-LD SHACL shapes](https://github.com/SEMICeu/DCAT-AP/blob/master/releases/3.0.0/shacl/dcat-ap-SHACL.jsonld)
  using this Python script: https://github.com/StroemPhi/dcat-4C-ap/tree/main/src/dcat-ap_shacl_2_linkml.py.

  NOTE:The JSON-LD SHACL constraints published with the [Juli 3.0.0 GitHub release](https://github.com/SEMICeu/DCAT-AP/releases/tag/3.0.0)
  and in the [3.0.0. release branch](https://github.com/SEMICeu/DCAT-AP/tree/3.0.0)
  are different from the ones in https://github.com/SEMICeu/DCAT-AP/tree/master/releases/3.0.0.
  Also the TTL shapes provided in the latter in the HTML folder differ from the ones
  in the SHACL folder, in that they declare dcat:Resource and dcatap:TemporalLiteral
  as unions of the dcat:Resource subclasses respectively different XML Schema datatypes
  for date and time. We address this with "helper code" in the conversion script.'
title: LinkML schema representation of DCAT-AP 3.0.0
todos:
- Think about how to add all the enums and their permissible values to constrain the
  allowed instances of classes such as "Concept", "MediaType", etc. as defined in
  https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0/#controlled-vocs. Using EnumBindings
  (https://linkml.io/linkml-model/latest/docs/bindings/) seems best, but does not
  yet work.
