Ckanext-dcat is a [CKAN](https://github.com/ckan/ckan) extension that helps data publishers expose and consume metadata as serialized RDF documents using [DCAT](https://github.com/ckan/ckan).

## Overview

In terms of CKAN features, this extension offers:

* [Pre-built CKAN schemas](https://docs.ckan.org/projects/ckanext-dcat/en/latest/getting-started#schemas) for common Application Profiles that can be adapted to each site requirements to provide out-of-the-box DCAT support in data portals, including tailored form fields, validation etc. (currently supporting DCAT AP v1, v2, and v3).

* [DCAT Endpoints](https://docs.ckan.org/projects/ckanext-dcat/en/latest/endpoints) that expose the catalog datasets in different RDF serializations (`dcat` plugin).

* An [RDF Harvester](https://docs.ckan.org/projects/ckanext-dcat/en/latest/harvester) that allows importing RDF serializations from other catalogs to create CKAN datasets (`dcat_rdf_harvester` plugin).

* Other features like [Command Line Interface](https://docs.ckan.org/projects/ckanext-dcat/en/latest/cli) or support for indexing in [Google Dataset Search](https://docs.ckan.org/projects/ckanext-dcat/en/latest/google-dataset-search).


These are implemented internally using:

* A base [mapping](https://docs.ckan.org/projects/ckanext-dcat/en/latest/mapping) between DCAT and CKAN datasets and viceversa (compatible with [DCAT-AP v1.1](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/dcat_application_profile/asset_release/dcat-ap-v11), [DCAT-AP v2.1](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/solution/dcat-application-profile-data-portals-europe/release/210) and [DCAT-AP v3](https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0/)).

* An [RDF Parser](https://docs.ckan.org/projects/ckanext-dcat/en/latest/profiles#rdf-dcat-parser) that allows to read RDF serializations in different formats and extract CKAN dataset dicts, using customizable [profiles](https://docs.ckan.org/projects/ckanext-dcat/en/latest/profiles#profiles).

* An [RDF Serializer](https://docs.ckan.org/projects/ckanext-dcat/en/latest/profiles#rdf-dcat-serializer) that allows to transform CKAN datasets metadata to different semantic formats, also allowing customizable [profiles](https://docs.ckan.org/projects/ckanext-dcat/en/latest/profiles#profiles).
